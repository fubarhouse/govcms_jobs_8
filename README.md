# govcms_jobs d8 build

This module is a custom module that can be installed on a vanilla govCMS (8.x) instance. There is also a D7 version of this module if you prefer that version. See https://github.com/senuamedia/govcms_jobs_7.

The module is designed to provision the content type, sync to the apsjobs website and pull all related taxonomy and job data based on access levels. It provides an admin UI to create new jobs and these jobs can be displayed via usual means from views, blocks etc.
